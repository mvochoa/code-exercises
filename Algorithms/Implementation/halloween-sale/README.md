# Halloween Sale
Reference: [https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/halloween-sale/problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/halloween-sale/problem)

You wish to buy video games from the famous online video game store Mist.

Usually, all games are sold at the same price, **p** dollars. However, they are planning to have the seasonal Halloween Sale next month in which you can buy games at a cheaper price. Specifically, the first game you buy during the sale will be sold at **p** dollars, but every subsequent game you buy will be sold at exactly **d** dollars less than the cost of the previous one you bought. This will continue until the cost becomes less than or equal to **m** dollars, after which every game you buy will cost **m** dollars each.

For example, if **p = 20**, **d = 3** and **m = 6**, then the following are the costs of the first **11** games you buy, in order:

```
20, 17, 14, 11, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
```

You have **s** dollars in your Mist wallet. How many games can you buy during the Halloween Sale?

## Input Format

The first and only line of input contains four space-separated integers **p**, **d**, **m** and **s**.

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ m ≤ p ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ d ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ s ≤ 10^4`

## Output Format

Print a single line containing a single integer denoting the maximum number of games you can buy.

## Sample Input 0

```
20 3 6 80
```

## Sample Output 0

```
6
```

## Explanation 0

We have **p = 20**, **d = 3** and **m = 6**, the same as in the problem statement. We also have **s = 80** dollars. We can buy **6** games since they cost **20 + 17 + 14 + 11 + 8 + 6 = 70** dollars. However, we cannot buy a **7**th game. Thus, the answer is **6**.

## Sample Input 1

```
20 3 6 85
```

## Sample Output 1

```
7
```

## Explanation 1

This is the same as the previous case, except this time we have **s = 85** dollars. This time, we can buy  **7** games since they cost **20 + 17 + 14 + 11 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 82** dollars. However, we cannot buy an **8**th game. Thus, the answer is **7**.
