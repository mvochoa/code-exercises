# Arrays - DS
Reference: [https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem)

An array is a type of data structure thant stores elements of the same type in a contiguos block of memory, In an array, **A**, of size **N**, each memory location has some unique index, **i** (where **0 ≤ i < N**), that can be referenced as **A[i]** (you may also see it written as **Ai**).

Given an array, **A**, of **N** integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, **N** (the number of integers in **A**).

The second lien contains **N** space-separated integers describing **A**.

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3`
- `1 ≤ A ≤ 10^4, where Ai is the ith integer in A`

## Output Format

Print all **N** integers in **A** in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

## Sample input 1

```
4
1 4 3 2
```

## Sample output 1

```
2 3 4 1
```
